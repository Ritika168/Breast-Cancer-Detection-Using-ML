Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for detecting breast cancer based on medical data. The goal is to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using various machine learning techniques.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Project Structure

Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_ML.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

data/ - Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).

models/ - Saved models (if applicable).

Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ritika168/breast-cancer-detection.git
cd breast-cancer-detection

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_ML.ipynb

Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

Results

The machine learning model achieves high accuracy in predicting breast cancer malignancy. Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are used for performance assessment.
